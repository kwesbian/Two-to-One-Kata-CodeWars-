`Set` object is a collection of unique values:
=============================================
     In the set, each value can only occur once.
      
`Split` => splits both input strings into individual characters
===============================================================
    It is a method that splits a string into an array of substings.
    This makes ot easier to manipulate and work with strings.

`Concat` => links the resulting arrays in a chain
=================================================
    It changes the substrings back into a string.
    It does not change the existing strings.

Adding all the characters to the `Set` object to avoid duplication
==================================================================
    As said above, no value is duplicated.

`Array.from` allows the `Set` object to be converted back to an array
=====================================================================
    This method returns an array from any object that exhibits lengthy properties.

`Sort` arranges the work in alphabetical order
==============================================
    Its work is to sort the array alphabetically.

Lastly, `join` joins the sorted array xters into 1 str
=====================================================
    Returns the array as a string.
